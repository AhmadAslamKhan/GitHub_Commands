Now if you are a new git user there are certain commands all new users must know to help them start working as soon as possible. Some of them are listed and explained below.

1. Init:

  This is the most basic command or you can say the first step of using git. This command is used to initialize a new git repository and get you started.
  
2. Clone:

  Git clone command simply creates a new repository by copying an already existing one.
  
3. Branch:

  Branch is used to create a copy of your project so that you can work on your project separately without disturbing the main code. This helps in making the code more secure, protecting it from sudden failures and problems. This is very useful when you’re testing new things.
  
4. Add:

  This command is used to prepare files which are going to be a part of the next commit telling git about the changes/updates to be made in the existing repository. 
  
5. Commit:

  This command is used to store the changes/updates to the current repository. Although the changes are stored in the current repository but these are not yet stored on the remote one yet.
  
6. Push:

  The push command is used to send the committed code from your local repository to the remote repository so it is stored and uploaded in main repository making it available for everyone in the project.
  
7. Pull:

  This command pulls (downloads/updates) code from the remote repository to the local repository on your system. Pull command is usually used when either your code was lost, you want to retain an older version of your code or when you’re working in teams with multiple people updating the code
  
8. Merge:

  This command is used to merge 2 different branches of a repository to a single one. Although it needs both branches to be conflict free. It is used to save the current branch with the main one.
  
9. Clean:

  This command is used to delete all untracked files. The files which have been created but haven’t been added to the repository.
  
10. Reset:

This command is used to rest/undo all the changes done in a directory.
